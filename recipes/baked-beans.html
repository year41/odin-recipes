        <p>These baked beans from scratch are made by combining navy beans, molasses, 
            and maple syrup to make this classic dish at home.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup navy beans, soaked overnight and drained</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place beans in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil 
                over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir ketchup, maple syrup, 
                brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and chili powder 
                together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Once beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve cooking liquid. Pour 
                beans into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; stir in chopped onion and molasses 
                mixture. Stir in enough reserved cooking liquid so sauce covers beans by 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 200 degrees 
                F (95 degrees C) and cook 6 hours longer, stirring beans after they have cooked 
                for 3 hours. Once beans are tender and sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove 
                from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
